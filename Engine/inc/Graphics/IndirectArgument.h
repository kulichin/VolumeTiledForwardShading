 *
 *  @brief Append IndirectArguments to an IndirectCommandSignature to specify the
 *  indirect commands to execute.
 *  
 *  @description One or more indirect arguments can be specified in an indirect
 *  command signature. An indirect argument can be one of the following:
 *      * Draw
 *      * DrawInstanced
 *      * Dispatch
 *  If an IndirectCommandSignature contains a Draw or DrawInstanced indirect argument
 *  then it is a graphics command signature and should not contain any Dispatch arguments.
 *  If an IndirectCommandSignature contains a Dispatch indirect argument then it is a 
 *  compute command signature and it should not contain any Draw or DrawInstanced arguments.
 *  
 *  Graphics command signatures should only be invoked on a GraphicsCommandBuffer.
 *  Compute command signatures can be invoked on a ComputeCommandBuffer or a GraphicsCommandBuffer.
 *  
 *  The format of the argument buffer that is passed to the ComputeCommandBuffer::ExecuteIndirect 
 *  function is determined by the order of the commands in the command signature.
 *  
 *  To specify the arguments in the argument buffer use the following structures
 *  depending on the argument type:
 *      * Draw:         DrawIndirectArgument structure.
 *      * DrawIndexed:  DrawIndexedIndirectArgument structure.
 *      * Dispatch:     DispatchIndirectArgument structure.
